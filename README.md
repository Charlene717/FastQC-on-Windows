# How to Operate FastQC on Windows

## 1. Download FastQC and Java
1. **Download FastQC** from the official website:  
   [https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)  
2. **Install a suitable Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**. You can find a link to a suitable Java version on the FastQC website, or you can install any standard JRE (version 1.8 or above should work).

## 2. Manual File Import and Execution
1. **Extract the FastQC zip file** to any convenient location on your computer.  
   For example: `C:\Tools\FastQC`
2. Inside the extracted folder, you will see a file named `fastqc` (or `fastqc.exe`) along with other supporting files.
3. You can run FastQC on a single file or multiple files by opening **Command Prompt** (or **PowerShell**), navigating to the FastQC directory, and entering a command such as:
   ```bash
   fastqc C:\path\to\your\data\sample1.fastq C:\path\to\your\data\sample2.fastq

# Note
**On Windows, you might need to run `fastqc.exe` directly, or include the `.exe` extension if itâ€™s not recognized automatically.**

## 3. Analyzing an Entire Folder of FASTQ Files
If you have an R script named `RUN_FastQC_Windows.R` that runs FastQC on all FASTQ files within a specified folder:

1. **Open the script `RUN_FastQC_Windows.R`** in any text editor (e.g., RStudio or Notepad).

2. **Modify the following within the script**:

   - **FastQC executable path**: Ensure the script points to the `fastqc.exe` file inside your extracted FastQC folder.  
     ```r
     fastqc_path <- "C:/Tools/FastQC/fastqc.exe"
     ```
     
   - **Target folder path**: Update the folder path containing your FASTQ files.  
     ```r
     data_folder <- "C:/Data/FASTQ_Files/"
     ```

3. **Run the script** in R or RStudio (or use `Rscript` from the command line):
   ```bash
   Rscript RUN_FastQC_Windows.R
